# cs-340-client-server-development

        How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python 
    module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the 
    advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
  -  The code I wrote for this project was simplistic in nature due to the limited use of the desired program. The hardest part about the code was ensuring it could establish a connection to the server I had running with the databases. Once a connection was established the module allowed whatever software that imported the functions to access documents from the AAC database. This module could very easily be bounced to other software that could potentially use it for their server or project. In the future I could change the server connection and use this to begin making my own database.
    
        How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements 
    that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
    What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
  -  When it comes to any problem in computer science I tackle the issue first with research. Whether it's reading any material I have or scowering the internet for references and function notes. I can then adapt or study the structure of my researched funtions and zero in on the requirements setup for the project. When it comes to my strategy, it hasn't differed for quite a few classes now, however I did reach out to my professor a few times during this course. Each time I emailed him it turned out that I made a silly mistake that could have very easily been avoided. I've come to learn that I need to do more debugging when I write my code to ensure I don't have code breaking instances like early on in this project.
    
        What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, 
    like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  -  Computer scientists have slowly become the backbone of the technological world. They design the software and browsers we enjoy without a second thought. They also design security, webpages, simple applications, and so much more. This module alone could be used to improve an offices data visualization for employees. The code is also simple enough that anyone can modify the underline functions to catch or search for more specific databases. Once the software and module are up and running you can sort/filter the information by clicking one of the predetermined filter buttons so that you can find a few more specific dogs. Without this software we would be forced to manually go through each requirement and document found in the database inorder to find which animals fit the description given to us. This can waste a lot of time, especially if you're the owner who pays for every wasted minute by employees.
